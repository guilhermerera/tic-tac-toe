# 📖 What I learned
I learned to work with two separate JS files: One for the interface interventions and the other for performing the math and game rules checks. It was also amazing to create a unique code that accepts many different inputs and depending on that input something different is displayed in the interface. Deeply integrating CSS with JS was a really cool challenge and I think I did well on it, but I know I need to improve a lot, so any feedback is welcome!
